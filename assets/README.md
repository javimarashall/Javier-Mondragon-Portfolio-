## Summary
This application contains my professional portfolio of applications I have created. The portfolio contains information about me, such as a photograph and a brief description of myself. It also contains my applications organized into different sections, Mern Stack, Node/loT, React/Javascript/CSS, and HTML/CSS. The portfolio also contains a Contact Me section with my cell number, e-mail, and linkedin information.

The applications contains some cool features like the image opacity changes when the pointer hovers over it and an image shadow when the pointer is active. The application also displays its contents differently depending on the screen size.
